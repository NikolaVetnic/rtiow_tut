# Ray Tracing in One Weekend

Original tutorial by Peter Shirley [can be found here](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). Some of the notation in the original tutorial caused my program to not compile, alternative solutions [can be found here](https://github.com/willprice/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend).
